	<h2>Taking Care of a Greyhound101</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Depending on where you rescue your greyhound from, you will be told what to feed your dog. Typically, they recommend white rice and chicken. This is what we feed our dog.*</li>
		<li>Put their food on a small stool.** - They are so tall, that it is bad for their necks/back if they have to lean way down every time they eat.</li>
		<li>Walk them on leashes. Or take them off of it while you are outside in the area. - Don't put them on one of those types of leashes that is between two trees and they can run in the area between them. They run so fast, that if they see a squirrel or small rabbit in the distance, they may start to chase it. Unfortunately, it's possible for them to run so fast that they break their own neck when they get to the end of the rope. Stick to walking them on leashes. Or, if you're comfortable with it and are very familiar with your dogs habits, you can let them off in a back yard to roam on their own, as they typically don't go too far.***</li>
		<li>Keep their crates around with the door open. When they're scared or uncomfortable, many will voluntarily head into their crates.</li>
		</ul>


			<p>*We do not. We feed her dog food. Shhhhh.</p>
			<p>**Or, you can get to the point where you open your dishwasher and set the food on the open door. Perfect dog height!</p>
			<p>***Proceed with caution. I am not guaranteeing your dog won't run away.</p>

	<h2>What to Expect When You're Expecting... A Greyhound</h2>
	<p>When my family adopted our first greyhound, we were told a lot about how take care of her, what to feed her and what not to do. It was all very helpful, so I've included many of these pointers; however, as with all new things, there were certiain items of note we had to learn on our own. Hopefully when you adopt your greyhoud, you can benefit from our mistakes...</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Females vs. Males</li>
		An interesting thing about adopting a greyhound from a previous life or racing, is that the way they are treated impacts their inherant 'dog' skills as well as their behaviors.

		When in the XX, the female crates are stacked on top of the male crates. So, the girls have to jump in and out of their crates, but the boys just walk right in. This means that if you adopt a male, you will likely have to teach them how to jump. 

		For example, when attempting to get her male dog into her SUV, a family friend had to lift her dogs upper legs into the car, and then pick up the hind legs and stick them into the car as well. They eventually learn how to on their own, but don't fault them when they stare at you blankly when a car door is opened. Susie, the Vanna White of the dog world, was kind enough to show you how it's done:

		<li>Chomping</li>

		Greyhounds are very calm animals, but just like other dogs, they still get very excited before going on a walk, getting a treat etc. When they are, they might start to "chomp." (Note, this is not an official term, but it'll do.) It's when theY lift their nostrils up, so that you can see their front teeth, and they they make little chomping motions with their jaw. While it looks a tad weird, they're actualy quite happy when they do this, so don't be alarmed! Embrace the chomping.

		<li>Mini runs</li>

		If you adopt a greyhound that has previously raced at a track, most likely they will sleep 90% of the day. You can't fault them for this, because, hey, they are retired and are enjoying the life of leisure they deserve. But, all of the greyhounds I've encountered still like to show off their skills every once in a while. So, surrounding areas permitting (ie. no cars, other animals, small children etc. around), you can let your greyhound off its leash and sprint circles in the back yard or run up and down the upstairs hallway. But, be careful, this may cause jealousy among the other neighborhood dogs.

		<li>Speed eaters</li>

		When you first adopt a greyhound, they will frequently astound you with their speed eating skills. This is because at the race tracks, the owners would feed them all together in the same area. So it was either eat. Or have your food be eaten. So, when feeding your new greyhound, do not interfere or make moves to grab the container while they are still eating until you are comfortable with them and they know you aren't trying to steal their food.

		<li>They're supposed to be that skinny</li>

		They're not being mistreated or starved -- that's just how they look!

	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<h3>What qualifies me to talk about Greyhounds</h3>

	My name is Lisa King and I live in Washington, D.C. My family has adopted two greyhounds, and so I have over 10 years of experience taking care of them. I am also an amateur greyhound photographer, as you can tell from this website's photos, so I also have that going for me... heh, heh -- kidding, guys. 

	Clearly biased, I still think greyhounds are fantastic pets. They are very docile and sweet, so they are great to be around small children and the elderly. As they're number one pasttime is sleeping, they are a very low-key animal. They also hardly ever bark or howl (unless trianed to... yes, my dad trained our dog to howl before her pre-dinner bone. We're sophisticatd like that). With their short hair, they don't shed too much, cutting down on the constant vacuuming and clearning up after them. They love to be petted and definitely like long walks. Plus, they come from a race track, so they know how good they've got it when they move on to living a life of luxury!

	Below are some additional references for adopting a greyhound.
